# Coding Test Angular - Open Restaurants

To complete this test use the current version of Angular, at time of writing this was Angular 7.

## Specification

* Your task is to read a JSON file that contains data describing the opening
times of a number of restaurants.
* Display the data using an Angular 7 App
* Provide a method for querying which of the restaurants are open at a specified date and time. 
* Let users add a new restaurant with opening times.

*Note that the data does NOT have to be persisted anywhere*

## Angular 7
Your code should include the use of the following
* Components
* Services
* Observables
* Dependency Injection

## Design
Use your design skills to style the page to look professional and appealing. 
Choosing appropriate font sizes and colors.
Feel free to use Bootstrap or Angular Material. If you do tell us why you choose the one you did and what features you used from these. 
Using pure CSS, SASS or SCSS is also acceptable.

## Test Data

Test data can be found in the `restaurant_data.json` file. Inspect this file
to determine the kind of input data that your code should be able to handle.

All the data in `restaurant_data.json` are correct and valid. You may add
additional entries for testing purposes, but please do not alter the existing
content.

## Additional Information

- All dates and times can be assumed to be in the same time zone
- The input file can be assumed to be well-formed and contain no invalid data
- Remember to write tests for your solution, particularly for any edge cases
  that could occur in the input data

## Deliverable

The deliverable is the source code and files required to build and run your
solution. Either a public git repository, e.g. GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket, or
a zip archive.

It should not include the node_modules directly. Packages should be able to be installed using npm/yarn and the app should be run by 'ng serve'.

Please also provide a README that contains the following:

- Any instructions needed to boot and test your solution
- A technical overview of the implementation, including:
  - A summary of its architecture.
  - Technical justification of key design decisions with comparison to other
    possible approaches.
  - Implementation notes that would help orient a coder new to the code
  - Any areas of the design or implementation that could be improved further or
    that you would like specific feedback on.

## Tips

- A simple and straightforward design is preferred. Avoid unnecessary
  complexity.
- Using a strict code linter is recommended
- Remove debug or other unnecessary code before submitting
